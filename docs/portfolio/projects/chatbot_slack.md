# **Case Study — Specialized Chatbots for Smarter Workflows**

## **Overview**

I developed a set of three **specialized chatbots**, each focused on a specific task: handling email responses, summarizing documents, and drafting posts or articles.

To make the interaction seamless, the bots are integrated into *Slack*, the platform already used by the client’s team for daily communication. Behind the scenes, the solution relies on *OpenAI* APIs to harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project is an example of how LLMs can be **integrated into everyday tools** and customized to create **simple, practical solutions** that support real work.

## **Technical Challenges & Solutions**
### Data Collection Pipeline
#### Challenges:
 - Different sources produce different formats (JSON, CSV, HTML, PDFs, APIs).
 - Web crawling requires dealing with rate limits, inconsistent page structures, and data cleaning.
#### Solutions:
 - Build a multi-source ingestion pipeline with connectors for databases, APIs, and file storage.
 - Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or frameworks like Apache Airflow / Prefect to standardize data.
 - Implement web crawlers (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup) with throttling, retries, and parsing rules.
 - Normalize into a common schema (e.g., JSONL) so that all downstream NLP models receive consistent inputs.
 - Add automated validation layers (checking duplicates, missing values, anomalies) before feeding data to the chatbot.   

### Cloud Platforms
#### Challenges:
 - Sensitive business data must be handled securely when deployed on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).
 - Poor authentication/authorization practices can lead to leaks or breaches.
 - Cloud compute costs can escalate quickly if not monitored, especially with GPU workloads.
#### Solutions:
 - Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) with least-privilege policies; apply role-based access controls.
 - Enable multi-factor authentication for administrators and service accounts.
 - Encrypt data both in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS-managed keys).
 - Implement network isolation (private VPCs, firewalls) to limit attack surface.
 - For cost control:
    - Use monitoring tools (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing, Azure Cost Management).
    - Set up budgets and alerts for abnormal usage.
    - Use spot/preemptible instances or autoscaling to optimize GPU/CPU usage.

### Prompt engineering
#### Challenges:
 - LLMs can produce hallucinations or irrelevant answers.
 - Specialized chatbots require controlled tone, compliance with policies, and reliability.
 - Prompts must balance flexibility with strict guardrails.
#### Solutions:
 - Design system instructions that set role, style, and boundaries (e.g., “You are a legal assistant. Only answer from the company’s approved knowledge base. If unsure, say you don’t know.”).
 - Use few-shot examples in prompts to guide desired responses.
 - Apply guardrails frameworks (e.g., Guardrails AI, LangChain output parsers) to enforce structure and correctness.
 - Combine retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) so answers are grounded in real documents instead of pure model recall.
 - Add confidence estimation and fallback: if the model is uncertain, escalate to human review instead of guessing.
